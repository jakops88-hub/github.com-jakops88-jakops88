Senior Full-Stack Engineer & Architect

I build software that is boring, reliable, and profitable.

My philosophy is simple: Technology is a delivery mechanism for value, not an art contest. I specialize in "Boring Stacks" (Monoliths, SQLite/Postgres, Vanilla JS/React) to minimize complexity and maximize shipping speed.

Currently exploring Local-First architectures and deterministic AI engineering.

Open Source Projects

MemVault
A local-first, observable memory server for AI Agents. Runs on PostgreSQL + pgvector. Designed to solve the "black box" retrieval problem in RAG pipelines.

Stack: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Ollama

Focus: Observability, Local Inference, Hybrid Search

ContextDiff
A semantic text analysis platform. It uses LLMs to deterministically verify that AI-generated content has not subtly changed facts or tone compared to the source material.

Stack: Python (FastAPI), Next.js

Focus: AI Safety, Deterministic Output, Compliance

Selected Writing

I write about software architecture and the "Senior Mindset" on Dev.to (3,000+ followers).

Work With Me

I am available for limited engagements as a Fractional CTO or Architectural Consultant.

I help early-stage startups and scale-ups:

De-risk their roadmap (Stop over-engineering).

Migrate to reliable stacks (Moving away from unmaintainable microservices).

Implement AI reliably (Building observable RAG pipelines, not demos).

If you want to ship faster with less complexity, get in touch.
